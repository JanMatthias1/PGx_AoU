# Exploring CYP2C19 Pharmacogenomics Using the All of Us Research Program Data

Pharmacogenomics, the study of how genetic variations impact drug response, has primarily relied on datasets from European descent to discover correlations between drug dosages and genes. This lack of diversity creates a significant gap, leaving doctors and regulators uncertain about how drugs might affect individuals from non-European descent. The availability of large genomic and drug dosage databases which encompass a diverse population is limited, thereby halting the opportunity to study the genetic effects on patient drug dosage. The All of Us research program, a national longitudinal study conducted by the National Institutes of Health, provides robust medical history, drug dosage and genomic data from a diverse population. This enables the study of pharmacogenomics across various demographic groups. Focusing on the Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme family, which metabolizes approximately 90% of clinically available drugs, we created a list of 161 drugs metabolized by the enzymes. We then identified significant differences in drug dosages across CYP450 metabolizer phenotypes. Furthermore, we sought novel drug-gene interactions by evaluating drug dosages of drugs metabolized by other CYP-metabolized drugs and CYP450 enzymes. Our results validated known interactors of CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A5. In addition, we identified meloxicam as a potential novel substrate of the CYP3A5 enzyme. Thus, we used the All of Us dataset to validate known drugs metabolized by CYP450 across a diverse population, demonstrating the potential utility of the All of Us dataset and routinely collected EHR data for pharmacogenomic studies. Moreover, we observed that meloxicam dose significantly differs across CYP3A5 enzyme phenotypes, suggesting that CYP3A5 may play a role in its metabolism.
