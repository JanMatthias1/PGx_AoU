# Exploring CYP2C19 Pharmacogenomics Using the All of Us Research Program Data

Pharmacogenomics, the study of how genetic variations impact drug response, has primarily relied on datasets from European descent to discover correlations between drug dosages and genes. This lack of diversity creates a significant gap, leaving doctors and regulators uncertain about how drugs might affect individuals from non-European descent. The availability of large genomic and drug dosage databases which encompass a diverse population is limited, thereby halting the opportunity to study the genetic effects on patient drug dosage. The All of Us research program, a national longitudinal study conducted by the National Institutes of Health, provides robust medical history, drug dosage and genomic data from a diverse population. This enables the study of pharmacogenomics across various demographic groups. In this paper, we investigate whether known drug-gene interactions can be recovered from the All of Us dataset, given the inherent noise of electronic health record data. Focusing on the Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme family, which metabolizes approximately 90% of clinically available drugs, we create a list of 161 drugs metabolized by the enzymes. We then identify significant differences in drug dosages across CYP450 metabolizer phenotypes. Our results validate known interactors of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A5. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of recovering pharmacogenomics associations using real-world, diverse data from the All of Us research program.
